>"US-align (Universal Structural alignment) is a unified protocol to compare 3D structures of different macromolecules (proteins, RNAs and DNAs) in different forms (monomers, oligomers and heterocomplexes) for both pairwise and multiple structure alignments. The core alogrithm of US-align is extended from TM-align and generates optimal structural alignments by maximizing TM-score of compared strucures through heuristic dynamic programming iterations. "
